# Mystique
A sample about how to create a dynamic plugins mechanism with ASP.NET Core Mvc based on the AssemblyLoadContext.

This whole project is built under .NET Core 3.1. 

## What i will do and what i will not do
I will build a plugin mechanism to load plugins at runtime. Each plugin will be isolated by custom AssemlyLoadContext. So the framework allow you to reference same library with different version.

## Pain spot and solutions
I just list down all the pain spot when i approach this feature, If you are good at Chinese, you can reference my cnblog (https://www.cnblogs.com/lwqlun/p/13208980.html). I have list down all of these in my blog. I will translate a English version later.
